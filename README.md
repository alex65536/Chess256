# About the program

_Chess 256_ is a chess program for playing, editing and analysing chess games. This project was supposed to be a very powerful chess application, but many features are missing by now. Though, many basic things have been already implemented.

The project is still considered in alpha state for some reason. Still, it's quite stable to use, as no critical bugs were found for a large amount of time.

# Features

* Support for standard chess formats (PGN for chess notation, FEN for positions and UCI chess protocol).

* Powerful PGN editor (support for comments, NAGs, variations...).

* Playing games between players, between engines and player vs engine.

* Also there is analysis mode, where you can add variations, comments, etc.

* Advanced time control options (you can define options like this: `2 hours per 40 moves, then 1 hour per following 20 moves and then 1 hour for the rest of the game`.

* Written on _Free Pascal_ using _Lazarus IDE_

# Missing things

* Game analysis.

* Charts showing position cost change in different moments of time.

* Notation nodes showing position cost and time stamp.

* Advanced notation features, such as diagrams.

* Games database.

* Support for a wider range of chess engines (WinBoard/XBoard, ...)

* Notation printing and exporting (to RTF, PDF, ...)

* Customization, custom icon sets, board pieces, etc.

Some missing things may also be found in [Todo.txt](https://github.com/alex65536/Chess256/blob/master/Todo.txt).

# History

I started this project in 2016. The purpose was to make a complete chess environment that has a wide range of features. I didn't know about _git_ and _GitHub_ at that moment of time, so previous version of _Chess 256_ were kept locally, without any version control system. In this period of time, the core of the project was developed: chessboard, clock, notation, engine subsystem and so on. But I abandoned the development.

In January 2018, I found this project and decided to release it under the GNU GPL. It took me some time to reformat all the sources and add GPL license headers for this.

I don't know if the development of _Chess 256_ will continue. But everyone is welcome to contribute to this repository and I will accept patches and, if there will be enough attention to my project, I will continue development :)

Many things has changed from 2016, especially in _Lazarus_ and _FPC_, many things were improved in them. So, there is some legacy code in _Chess 256_ to replace parts of _Lazarus_ that were unstable or missing in 2016 (e. g. imitation docked interface instead of using _AnchorDocking_ package). This parts will be removed.

# Supported platforms and pre-requisites

At first, it uses _FPC/Lazarus_ and, as _Lazarus_ states, "write once, compile anywhere". But, as it appears, _Chess 256_ doesn't work correctly with some widgetsets.

_Chess 256_ is tested to work correctly on _Windows_ and _GNU/Linux_. The best supported widgetset is _gtk2_. _win32_ widgetset also works pretty well, but the chessboard renders uglier.

Other widgetsets are not tested or unsupported:

* _qt_ (and _qt5_) has problems with rendering the notation.

* _fpgui_ and _customdrawn_ (checked on _GNU/Linux_) have problems with even lauching the program.

* _carbon_ and _cocoa_ are not tested.

_Chess 256_ successfully builds on _Lazarus 2.0.x_ with _FPC 3.0.4_ or _FPC 3.2.x_. Older versions of _FPC_ and _Lazarus_ were not tested.

[Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org) is the default chess engine for _Chess 256_. You will need the _stockfish_ executables to run the program successfully.

# Building _Chess 256_

Pre-requisites for building _Chess 256_ from sources:

* Common: `make`.
* _Chess 256_ application: `lazarus (>= 2.0), fpc (>= 3.0.4)`
* _Stockfish_: `g++`
* _Chess 256_ icons and glyphs: `inkscape, imagemagick`

First, you may need to install the _CmdBox_ package into the IDE (located at [`Packages/CmdBox`](https://github.com/alex65536/Chess256/tree/master/Packages/CmdBox)).

For building _Chess 256_, you may use _GNU Make_. `Makefile` of the project has many different targets for building different parts of the project (the application, _Stockfish_ engine or images).

Also, the project can be built from the Lazarus IDE.

On Debian-based systems you can also build a `.deb` package for _Chess 256_. Use `make deb` or `debuild -us -uc`.

# Third-party software used by _Chess 256_

* [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org) chess engine

* CmdBox package which provides a command line component for the debug console. _**NOTE**_: _Chess 256_ uses the modified version of _CmdBox_, which adds some new methods to this component. The modified version can be found in this repo, [`Packages/CmdBox`](https://github.com/alex65536/Chess256/tree/master/Packages/CmdBox) directory.
